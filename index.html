    <h1>NEXTBOTS</h1>
 <p>What Is NextBot?</p>
<p>NextBot is an AI system that's used in some Source Engine games, including Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2. NextBot uses a "navigation mesh" or "navmesh" system for navigation, allowing NPCs to navigate maps in more sophisticated ways.</p>
    <H1>1 - Obunga</H1>
 <P>Obunga refers to a photoshopped image of former U.S. President Barack Obama distorted to resemble roach creatures from the manga Terra Formars, which has been described as a cursed image. 
 <p>While the exact origin of the photoshopped image is unknown, the earliest archived instance on 4chan was submitted to the /tv/ (television) board on July 24, 2013.</p>

 <h1>2 - Quandale Dingle </h1>
<p> Quandale Dingle is the name of a Pennsauken high school football player featured in a series of goofy ahh shitpost memes based on a viral screenshot of a PC login screen for a man with the name. The earliest known upload of the screenshot was posted to TikTok in September 2021 and went viral through reposts, inspiring further memes referencing the name and how ridiculous it is. In late 2021 throughout early 2022 people began using distorted images of people, mostly images of rapper NBA Youngboy, to represent Quandale Dingle in ironic memes. The name also inspired a trend where TikTokers create parody RapTV posts about Quandale.</p>

<h1>3 - Sanic Hegehog </h1>
<p> On August 30th, 2013, Steam users Xyxen and Nate Wingman posted a Garry's Mod addon NPC to the Steam Workshop. The NPC is modeled after the Sanic Hegehog meme. It is programmed to be invincible and chase the player across a given map. 
The addon became notably popularized in the following years, boasting a five-star rating with over 15,000 votes and 370,000 subscribers by June 2022. 
The NPC appeared in numerous videos over the following years where players run from Sanic in an attempt to survive as long as possible</p>

<h1>4 - Selene Delgado</h1>
<p>During the 90s and 2000s, a TV channel in Mexico called Canal 5 run a segment known as "Servicio a la Comunidad" that would show images of people that had gone missing along with a voice-over describing each of them. During 2001, one of the people reported was a woman known as "Selene Delgado" with an accompanying image. Due to the low-quality of the image shared, people started making theories about Selene Delgado (with some saying the image was AI-generated) and eventually ended up becoming a popular Mexican urban legend.

The image of the nextbot is not actually from this broadcast, but is rather a police sketch of Derrick Todd Lee, the Baton Rouge Serial Killer. This image is often associated with Selene Delgado due to the amount of creepy videos comparing them and a lot of other faces (such as This Man's), though it is not the original image of her.
